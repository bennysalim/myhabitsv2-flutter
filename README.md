## Getting Started : I want to try this project locally

Before you start using this project, you have to  download Flutter SDK from [Flutter Official Website Here](https://flutter.dev) also Android/iOS SDK included in your machine.

After above, you can use this Flutter project to build new .apk/.ipa file by cloning the project

```git clone https://github.com/bennysalim/myhabitsv2-flutter```

Next you have to get the dependencies because this repository project doesn't already include the package by go to the terminal, change directory to ```cd myhabitsv2-flutter```, and get the dependencies using Flutter CLI ```flutter pub get```.

Next you can run the app from lib/main.dart from your VSCode/IntellIJ IDEA using smartphones/emulator.
